              <h3>Brunel (current)</h3>
              <p>Brunel is a huge job platform, located with offices all over the world. At Brunel we're currently building

            Stream Elements is a company that wants to bring fame and fortune to streamers. They have a wide range of tools
            to help up and coming streamers to give them exactly that
          </p>

          <p>
            During my time at StreamElements I worked on the Youtube product. Creating an dashboard with all the stats you
            want to see as a streamer. My role was to create new features like Dynamic Thumbnails, bulk editing / publishing and
            add integrations for the dynamic video descriptions.

            Within Secfi I was part of team Ramen. We were constantly refining  our on-boarding process so new users can have the best experience from the very start.
            In addition, we create intuitive tools that ensure our clients have the necessary information to make decisions about their equity.

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Something about me...</h2>
        <p>So you might want to get to know me a bit more personal huh.. I'm a 29 year old front-end developer. Way way way back,
        I studied interaction design, but through my internships I found out I had more passion for development.
        </p>

        <h3>Some professional background</h3>

        <p>
          During my agency career I've had the honor (and they had the honor to work with me) to work with some amazing brands.
          For example <Anchor href={"https://www.makelaarsland.nl"}>Makelaarsland</Anchor>, <Anchor href={"https://www.green-village.nl"}>Green Village</Anchor> and <Anchor href={"https://www.emerce.nl"}>Emerce</Anchor>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now a days I work mostly in <strong>React</strong> (NextJS) and <strong>CSS modules</strong>. I also do CSS in JS, fetch data in anyway you want (GraphQL, REST),
          but honestly a simple wrapper around fetch will do for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides Front-end I also play around with some back-end and stuff, <strong>NodeJS</strong> mostly, I am after all, a Javascript Developer. At
          this moment creating an app to keep track of my fitness journey. Making this in <strong>NextJS</strong>, <strong>Postgress</strong>, <strong>Prisma</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong>.
          Interested in checking it out once it's done? Just drop me an email and I'll make sure you'll be one of the beta testers. üëç
        </p>

        <h3>But, what do I do in my free time?</h3>

        <p>
          When I do have some free time, you can probably find me at the gym. You know, all that sitting and stuff,
          its nice to get some movement in as well. Besides that I have a huge passion for watches, vintage  or new, doesn't matter to me, but
          it combines two hobbies of mine, design and development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I do have a race bike, which I probably could use more, but it's still beautiful to look at I guess. I run, not for a specific reason, but it is
          a nice way to clear my head and stay fit. Then there is my little dog Ziggy, who needs a shit ton of attention so that keeps me busy during the day as well.
